# Applications

The `app` folder contains execution scripts for training on images and nerfs (video coming soon).

Each app includes its own set of argument definitions, configs, README file and where needed, also a `requirements.txt` for installing additional packages.

Interactive rendering functionality is enabled for nerf from Kaolin Wisp, but is disabled for the image app.
